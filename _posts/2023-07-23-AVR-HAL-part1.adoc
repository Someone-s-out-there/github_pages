== What is this

This is a personal project to make my own HAL for the AVR chips. until i've fleshed out the hal enough it will *only* support the Atmega328P.

The HAL will be written in C++ with classes and namespaces. this is mostly as a proof of concept to see if its reasonable for private experiments. the HAL will be hosted on Github https://github.com/Someone-s-out-there/AVR-HAL[Github]

== What it should be able of doing.

The HAL will be considered "finished" when it can configure all the periphirals of the Atmega328P. 
this means that it will be able to control

- 2 8-bit timers
- 1 16-bit timers
- 6 PWM channels
- 8 channel 10-bit adc
- 1 usart
- 1 SPI
- 1 TWI/I2C
- 1 WDT
- Interrupts

When this is finished i hope to be able to extend the HAL to also cover the Attiny 0 and 1-series chips i have. how ever they use a different architecture
